    "overview": "Frontend development focuses on creating user-facing interfaces for websites and applications, combining design and technology to deliver seamless user experiences. Current trends include the dominance of JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue.js, and Angular, as well as a growing emphasis on responsive design, accessibility, and performance optimization. The rise of tools like TypeScript, WebAssembly, and modern CSS frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS) is reshaping workflows. The future outlook remains strong due to increasing demand for interactive web applications, with emerging opportunities in progressive web apps (PWAs), cross-platform development, and integration with AI/ML tools. Career prospects are robust, with roles spanning startups to enterprise-level companies.",
